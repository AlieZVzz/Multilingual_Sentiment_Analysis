1	Love always knows how to cherish when it is about to lose
1	The plot is unconventional and the production is OK Although there are many defects the defects do not hide the jade Finally we were moved It is not because the great saint returned but because we finally saw the hope of domestic animation
1	In fact the plot is a little weak especially the ending is too hasty Maybe there is a reason for editing but dont worry The production of conscience has made our blood boiling in Riman Meiman Dasheng is not handsome but he is just a proud monkey but the heroes behind the scenes are really handsome
1	Good comedy
1	Seriously the special effects in the cinema are really pretty good In the assembly of bad films for the new year I think it has passed At least it has not been wronged for spending money and its appearance has also passed Wu Yifan should be better if he speaks Cantonese Its best to have a full dubbing | so many people give a score of 1 point You like talking big The ending film of the journey to the west is 1 point
1	When the monkey came back in armor it was not as brilliant as I thought It was the effort when the middle mana was bound that made me feel incomparably handsome In addition the dragon in the film was simply beautiful and glittering The music was generally good but when Wang Fengs song came out it felt very abrupt
0	Half of you were forced to register a watercress number and give a score You always like Mr He very much but this film is too bad Well PPT film also has a transition between the preceding and the following What you omit 1000 words here for imagination is why you kneel for the five-star If you are Li Yifengs fans I have nothing to say If not you touch your conscience and say that this thing is a movie isnt it
1	July and Anson you have me and I have you Even though their personalities are very different the cruelty of fate still makes them have to face the reality They only live to 27 years old and then they exchange their lives In July they love Anson How can Anson not understand that a conscience domestic youth film is very characteristic and the characters are portrayed in detail

1	Ghost blowing lights and tomb robbing notes are the same They are one story after another If only a nine story demon tower is played it will be very monotonous so it also includes plays such as Jingjue ancient city This is a movie
1	The first half of the special effects and modeling of the four stars are good and creative but the last three Buddhas are so strange that they dont hold
1	Its not that bad but I dont like it very much Maybe I didnt understand the film and didnt resonate

1	At 630 on the lunar Lantern Festival the advance point of a person going to see the city of love reflects the cinema Looking up at the sky the moon is really round A light comedy but I burst into tears There will always be a person waiting for me to give up my so-called dream because Im not enough Why not jump again? May what I insist on always be as I wish Thank you Come on
1	Its embarrassing when the plot develops later Fortunately Qiu didnt die He said that the female owner and the male were trapped in the whole village In fact I think in the final analysis the female owner and the male were trapped by two old people The mouse woman wants to return to lingpo and look for a successor The picture is much better than the domestic animation The plot is worse than the great saint but we can see that there is progress Finally the crowdfunding list is still very moving

0	Its really a bad film Give it to two stars
1	Each chapter is very clear Starting in winter but ending in winter the relationship between friends is always more true than love at first sight When they quarrel about their dreams they see their own shadow Movies can always rewrite and reproduce the story but life is a performance without rehearsal There are several times that they want to cry but they suppress them and want to see another painful and happy cry

1	Bucky is eternal love

1	The best domestic grass mud horse of the year has been waiting too long
0	In addition to the fight in the first 10 minutes and the last 30 minutes I saw too many sleepy characters at other times Everyone skimmed the water There was no depth at all They ran fast When they died they were completely insensitive to the fight special effects But is the city in the sky the end of the special effects? Its all close-up A dogs tail and minks money fraud work will not be seen in the future 510
0	I can only see the Dragon search formula
1	The ending is a little painful
1	You are my unrealistic dream Although it ended with who looks back and who is stupid its a good movie Im still familiar with Los Angeles
0	OK Im here to give a low score This film is not as wonderful as online slightly smiling Face on the contrary I feel quite embarrassed in many places What have those who watch crying experienced in their youth
1	A rare youth film a girl feels the pain of a womans growth and loves her
1	Its a good-looking comedy that suits my appetite Its good in all aspects Its natural to laugh natural to get excited natural to cry Then some nostalgic songs are really good works
1	Although Jackie Chans return kidnapped the patriotic complex the empty sermon was really reluctantly but it was still a work of sincerity with more intentions The last scene of the 58 year old body rolling down from the crater was moving It was really not easy
1	The plot is not very clear but the fight is wonderful
0	How can it be so ugly? Is there a screenwriter for this film
0	Its really disgusting to make some cold humor to cater to the audience

1	I gave the movie to three stars and half stars and the other half stars to Xingye Xingye is old This movie is made for the past
0	Half for special effects half for Shu Qi and Lin there can be no more updates The acting skills of others are really embarrassing
1	Stephen Chow is actually pessimistic
0	The picture is beautiful and Kim Shijias voice is also very encouraging In addition Im embarrassed to see the BGM in the transition dance I love to destroy a city alone In other words those who can see the jeep style from it have only seen Hayao Miyazakis animated films
0	Because there are three words of Stephen Chow otherwise I really want to curse people and squeeze Rotten films also invite a lot of sailors to cheat money
1	Jackie Chans collection of mountains played a role in my creativity when I was a child
1	Great a different saint
0	When I was in the cinema I was imagining that if this was a domestic film it would be spewed out shit Chinese people can find out all kinds of reasons why the female owner is not good-looking The plot is old-fashioned the plot is messy the ending is inexplicable 87 high scores have the Navy etc However fortunately this is a foreign film There are not a few people licking foreigners ass in China What do those who say they are not good-looking and hit four stars mean
0	So far a film that made me want to vomit later had a shadow on Li Yifeng so that I didnt dare to go into the cinema when he played old gun Im sorry Guan Hu is to blame He Jiong remembered to vomit again
1	Its a surprise that there is no urine point in the whole movie After watching it I concluded that a man is the same residue for him to live a few more lives At the end of the story the screenwriter is also ironic D
1	Kuo and Zhou Er Mao were also regarded as comedies
0	ha-ha
1	It looks good I want to see it again
1	The plot is very simple As a domestic animation the picture quality and style are excellent which is praised by the great saint
1	I LIKEso mark
1	Its not a masterpiece but its worth recommending This monkey has accompanied too many peoples childhood From this film it will always accompany us Our hero has never been a Facebook In the old version of journey to the west he has earned countless tears because he was wronged by his master He is a distressed monkey This film follows Stephen Chows sun Dasheng He has a responsibility and everyone is waiting for him Wake up and finally one day the great sage returns
1	DC has just finished Hes crazy about these stupid human marvels and beat himself up Isnt that enough
0	The praise of others has given me two stars Its rare to see a youth film without abortion but youth is just turning over and over Its really boring
1	The captain of the United States series is more and more beautiful even surpassing the brilliance of the second couplet The words of the PS little spider fight with those of the dead waiter
1	Love has so many forks but once it goes far it becomes a thing of the past Perhaps the greatest happiness in life is that there is no regret and the greatest success is that there is no if
1	The two-star plot the four-star special effects set by the three-star people and the sincerity of the production team to seriously do animation the five-star looks forward to the positive energy injected into Chinese animation films by this series of films
0	In those years you can see that there are no thieves in the world with big mobile phones You are also picky You cant go to Douban Mangai film There will never be a man who keeps drawing on the phone in the cinema nor a middle-aged woman who forcibly laughs from beginning to end Today reality slaps you and tells you not to dream Youre crazy Youre completely crazy Contemporary life cant be said to be complete finished
1	A movie about heroes is more than gold heroes but unlike Batman Im worried that its not good to make such things into weapons in the future
1	Hatred blinds the eyes and lights a star for the young king
0	In fact you can also give special effects to two stars
1	Im hesitant to give five points Although its really a good film I laugh at too many women in the film They dont have acting skills and can only sell their faces But when I found that the woman in this film is good but her face is really lacking I realized my hypocrisy
1	Giving the film full marks is more due to the plot of the post-90s Monkey King Objectively speaking the plot of the return of the great sage is hard and not very novel but the highlight of the whole film is the character of the character The honest and wordy river flow son of the great sage specializes in selling cute silly girls charming second martial brother handsome little white dragon poisonous tongue chaos and even the land father-in-law and mountain demons are cute The wind and music are great
1	Its OK Although its exaggerated its valuable to relax New Years films should be like this
0	The whole film feels like the final ending song is good
1	In fact the intention is very common but the highlight is the comic effect and form of expression Positive gives people positive energy brightens their eyes selects a spouse and cherishes the present No matter poor or rich some things cant be bought with money
1	I wont watch the third movie without Nini
1	Cherish the people in front of us we are all happy 
1	You can see
1	I havent seen it yet but theres no reason to play five stars first I like it
1	I was surprised that his father was not a real father but I always felt that there was no end at the end
1	The music is so beautiful
1	Too many highlights too much to say great 
1	There must be a lot of flaws in the sincere work but I am still very satisfied In particular the plot of the fight is slightly thin and the action of the comedy is a little deliberate and reluctant However it is unreasonable not to go to the cinema to support this sincere work when I think that other messy bad films can sell for more than one billion
1	When dreams come true reality can be found in movies
1	Great great
1	There are always unhappy times in life and there are always bad moods At this time comedy movies are needed to adjust The most impressive thing is that Yin Zhengs pruning plum is very popular
0	Are you kidding me
1	Bajie section is a little disgusting Huang Bos shape is more funny
1	No I think its funny Its a good domestic film
0	Two stars for Qiu and two stars for Jiang sir Whats the hot chicken thing
1	Very nice
1	This is not a journey to the west its a journey to Thailand
1	Its much better than expected Jackie Chans usual funny and fighting way The plot is general The last friendship is still good Jiao Jiao finally corrected her name  ha ha
0	Finally I saw the legendary divine film The deep sense of powerlessness only existed when I watched the legend of the heavenly eye and the prince and 108 evil spirits However the film is still a little interesting Sometimes its like watching Daming Palace CI again; Sometimes its like watching Eastern evil and Western poison; Sometimes its like watching Chihiro
0	With Stephen Chows feelings the special effects made by Tsui Hark are OK The plot story is really chaotic Especially after Lin Yun came out Bai Gujing fell in love with Tang monk We can only use four words to describe the mess
1	Laughing crying crying and laughing hide tears so what is a good job what is a good friend and what is a good couple? Its really impossible to say if we dont get it if we lose it its always the right thing because we cant go back to the past so cherishing now has become the most important but most difficult proposition to realize
1	Donny beloved
1	Dont criticize funny comedies with the eyes of watching the drama
1	Li Yifeng is handsome
1	The typical Jackie Chan movie is easy and funny Some clips in it look deja vu and feel very similar to the flying eagle plan They are all treasure hunters with three women around them However one of the twelve zodiac animals can fight and the other two are idiots The flying eagle is hit by a hard hat Here it has become a fragment of bone women shooting indiscriminately Jackie Chan has also appeared in the flying eagle Self directed and self acted films are sincere
1	See cry
0	Yao Chen has very cute short hair
0	The first time I derailed Doubans score may be because I was not interested in song and dance films and the female hosts face is not my type so one star for the male host and one star for the final outcome I havent thought out how such a vulgar plot sublimated at the end It was really unexpected but its only so
0	Relying on Lin Xinxins acting skills there are really a lot of people without limits especially when master slapped himself and knelt down I felt embarrassed
1	Samsung half is getting more and more aesthetic tired of the womens Federation series In contrast they prefer the dark wind of DC The whole film doesnt feel too high Its always a little worse To put it bluntly the womens Federation 25 In addition in the face of the enemy who killed his father you cant let the iron man beat the Winter Soldier out of anger You have to have a degree of foundation
0	The volunteer Navy is all over greater China
1	The plot is really unexpected It subverts the concept of the journey to the West The image of the four masters and disciples is creative and fashionable I know why we dont prepare colored eggs for the new years reunion Is there no music
1	The painting style is beautiful and the imagination is great but its too bitter
1	Its beautiful in the woods Its just as good in the back
0	The special effects and pictures are good
0	I cant go on watching such a movie because Ive seen less than half of it
0	A sheer waste of time
1	I wanted to give it to four stars but compared with Guo Jingmings horror Valley film I think its valuable for people to make commercial films seriously in China
1	Generally from December someone recommended to watch the picture with great expectation Its a good song to hear the praise of the protagonist Unfortunately it didnt touch me Its too long in front of me even ten minutes later
0	Its to make the bad films with low scores rough
1	I feel a few lines are very philosophical The film is also trying to express a theme I like it very much
1	I feel like I want to finish shooting the original book of the journey to the West In terms of expressiveness it is really in line with the original book It is better than the 86 version of the journey to the West There is no ideal personality to beautify the truth goodness and beauty People are not perfect gold and barefoot It is understandable for those who brush one star After all it has tarnished the ideal journey to the West in your heart
1	Maybe the scattered watching didnt move my heart  but there is a film review that thinks its very good Will a voice touch a scene a few years later remind you of your past memories and make people cry
1	Now we drink at night and the sound of broken dreams is the sound of Beidao
0	The boring plot wants to go every minute
1	After laughing there were tears When Shu Qi sang love of life he felt that he had returned to the grade of the big talk journey to the West
1	Its feelings
1	There are a lot of people watching the film The plot is nothing to say Its still a very old American hero but the 3D production is really good I feel that the full screen is full of money The American humor is very funny Everyone laughs every time Then we vaguely discuss the funny points Its strange Its worthy of the ticket money to watch the film I recommend you to watch it
1	This music is still classic
1	Its commendable I hope theres a second one that can be continued
1	Mahatma v587
0	This is a love story of a girl stabbing and mending the sky
1	Very violent very cheerful
1	I dont know what to say
1	Stephen Chow is the biggest reason for me to watch this film The film that actors like is really rare It was originally thought to be a pure comedy but many places are very scary
1	Serious movies are better than the splicing MV of a group of young people pretending to cry and giggle and a group of guest stars Very grounded jokes look at Shen Teng Mary and their wrinkles are also pleasing to the eye
1	After watching the colored eggs he was kind and painful From then on he lived alone in that building forever and forever with his thoughts and regrets for Chun QAQ
1	Is infatuated with superheroes My favorite beauty team is a hero of the world One day he will come to me with colorful auspicious clouds
1	Very good-looking

0	Cant you give it to the stars? There are pictorial pictures in the childhood You can see the Gardenia bloom which is only the rotten and vulgar little freshness of the picture quality in the South Lake In short the childhood groups tear B gardenia first women and then men
1	It was a wonderful game
1	Its better to forget in the Jianghu than to help each other
1	Its good-looking and likes to cry for several times The double female owners are great [1 xiaoan grows too much like Yue Yunpeng I want to laugh as soon as she comes out; 2 when watching the film there are a pair of sisters and brothers sitting next to her The little boys are thirteen or fourteen years old They cover their eyes when an Sheng takes off his clothes in July Ha ha ha ha; 3 Su Jiaming I want to laugh at the name inexplicably [Mingming cried several times but kept laughing Its interesting I wont jump today
0	Not very nice
0	Vulgar sexual as a selling point ugly young middle-aged why is there a bachelor crisis in China? Youll know after watching this film
1	Jackie Chan who protects the dragons head was moved
1	Its OK The plot and characters are a little messy but the special effects are really awesome Just pay more attention to the key points in the plot
1	Characters 4 points plot 3 points special effects 4 points no blowing no stepping or not enough Give 5 points for my tears I dont deny that the extra points are due to my feelings The actual 35 points are at least lost in the loss of the plot Finally I hope the great saint will make further progress This time we go through a difficult journey The next one will let us see with our real skills that we can break through the clouds be presumptuous and unruly
1	At that time I just couldnt jump out of the play nor was it sad and tearful nor was it wild laughter More than warmth and humor these two elements were soft and just right I like PS especially when I saw it the day before Hong Kong embarrassing cant help but compare it smiling face
1	Although it didnt meet my expectations I still have to support Guoman film

0	Its really the cold horror of the role of fried cold rice I covered the little pig several times Face the warmth in the last few minutes of the play is abrupt false full screen Internet catchwords and old routines The nostalgia of Xu Ke and Zhou Xingchi two white haired old people is not fresh but sad Conceptualize and repeat the story of love in life Put it down but never let it go The most difficult thing is that the comedy classic is gone but now it is difficult to find a good work in the flashy world

0	The picture is Korean music Its Japanese Why is it called domestic animation? Because the money to be circled is RMB By the way you can take the word domestic for moral kidnapping After 12 years of emotional stem speculation you have produced such a three-dimensional retarded drama The return of Da Sheng is the hope of domestic animation
0	I cant understand why the score is so high I was cheated into the cinema by Douban score
1	The well-made plot may be a little incoherent Generally speaking its great The kung fu panda is a foreigner who weaves dreams with classic Chinese elements The return of the great sage is a Chinese It may be insufficient to build the future of Guoman with Chinese artistic conception and the soul of martial arts but Im satisfied
1	Summer heatstroke out of a certain consistency between the picture and the atmosphere this animation can really ignore the story structure and spread out The feeling opens my new understanding of the non narrative of animation Why does it sound so ironic o ╯ □ system o I really mean it Hahaha I really dont force myself to deduce the story Its really summer heatstroke

1	I feel very good Its very high to see many heroes fighting together in the popcorn movie
1	I have to say that Douban and Zhihu are really a strong wind
1	Story Samsung adds one star to this step of domestic animation
1	In fact the story theme of this film is similar to that of Hong Kong embarrassing It is to find the first love and the first dream The difference is that the narrative mode is different Hong Kong embarrassing is in the form of road film Xia is in the form of crossing In terms of comedy it is not as good as Hong Kong embarrassing

1	Its not easy to shoot this
1	Only by watching with your heart can you see the warmth in the film Only those who are warm in your heart can see the warmth in the film Watching Gardenia bloom is not so much watching the film as watching memories It is washing the impetuous mind polluted by the earth Out of the cinema there is only full of warmth and moving in your heart I want to say thank you for my youth and thank you for your youth

0	I cant accept that the black widow and the Hulk are together without warning and eagle eye has a family for no reason
1	Its probably the best in the domestic films of the same type but in fact the routine is the same Those things of two girls always inevitably revolve around men or that sentence When can we not use death to separate the story
1	Finally the blessing of a tearful smile Only those who have loved too much understand whether everything will be different if they go back to the first moment and start over again But they look at each other so relieved and full of love So I think how can this be the end of life? It is a journey of chasing dreams At a certain point in time a person meets a person They grow up together and encourage each other There is beauty and pain There is growth and regret This is life
1	Those friendship actors are really the highlights
1	The laughter is very explosive and the scene is scary and bloody Its really useless to take children to see Shu Qis acting

0	You can make bad films of the year
1	Its not how good the film is but its much better against these films now
1	Dont waste movie tickets Some paragraphs are amazing porridge frozen fish and some tones can be better
1	There is a suspicion of learning from European and American animation in terms of style and the plot is weaker but the later is the key point the plot is basically smooth and the special effects have no words Different people have different opinions on the soundtrack Generally speaking the best domestic animation works deserve to be given to the four stars
1	Here is to the one who dream
1	Ive been thinking about where the M14 used by the Chinese police came from and the big boss must be a loyal player of Tencent crossing the line of fire Gold sand eagle and gold AK are good losers
1	The plot is a little flawed the rhythm is a little inaccurate but the whole super surprise
1	Super good-looking is absolutely in line with Chinas big hand animation which is perfect and comparable to Hollywood special effects The sound effect is great but some places jump very fast but they still give full marks I hope you can promote and improve the box office

1	Very nice smiling face with Heart eyes the Buddhas palm appears behind monk Tangs stupidity and becomes a white monk Hes so handsome smart face with Heart eyes good performance and the special effects of Qi Tian Da Sheng are also very cool Spider essence is very amorous White bone essence is very infatuated The scene of fighting red boy is amazing Im very happy and a little bitter Tang Monk still cant let go of Miss Duan persistent face
1	The picture is good The image is bright and lovely and the plot is general
1	Very good
0	Er I dont think we should incorporate the film into the screenwriters personality but I still think In short if a girl is not good-looking she has to compromise and endure the heros death Only when the hero who is scum from beginning to end finally wakes up in a big dream can he be lucky to get a life with more respect Ha ha the screenwriter has a face
1	For those who have been paying attention to domestic animation it is really hopeful that the works do feel the sincerity different from commercial films and young animation but really there is little publicity even the heavy rain Begonia that jumps tickets every year is more than it

1	Gods new clothes and pepper
1	Super love
1	I went to see it with friends of American drama controllers because I was in a traffic jam for half an hour but my sincere praise is worth it for a simple rough and direct girl like me
1	Indeed it was the most worrying scene in Marvel fans The so-called agreement and separation were external incentives The adherence to the old buddy was the main reason for the final division of the group When fans were lamenting the blooming of the shield winter railway who remembered that the war machine couldnt even stand up and the reason why the captain was respected by the American people He was born upright and walked around with everyone but I was alone The character of the past is also the embodiment of the American spirit

1	Its really nice
1	The plot of the story is good From a professional point of view there is still room for improvement in some materials However it is a pity to ignore these technologies in the whole film However the success of the film leads to too high praise I hope not to ignore the quality just for the sake of interests in the future
1	ha-ha

1	I cant find any comment except conscience
0	Just two points One is lingpo who only likes the dubbing of Jin Shijie The other is that I want to order seven friends for Qiu
1	From the beginning of winter to the end of winter the result is reasonable but unexpected Their love starts as astringent as most people sweet and happy but ends with bitterness Two young people with dreams are finally bruised by reality The things in the film will recall countless memories Maybe they are moved by themselves
1	The expectation is too high but its not so surprising People still have to do what they like because a lover eventually becomes his predecessor During the film viewing process he keeps thinking of begin again PS who likes all the little skirts of the hostess
1	All the people in the world say that Yifan is handsome or the article is performed well Where is the Tang monk in ancient and modern times? Without his wordy words all the people in the world know that the special effects are good Compared with subduing the devil he has improved his sincerity for three days and has closed his eyes for a long time Lin Yuns body is really good Only Shu Qi cant forget to update his acting skills He is much worse than Huang Bo All the people in the world know that Xingye is good Only Tsui Hark cant forget his brain disabled fans He has survived for about 7 points
0	Watching the gun version on the Internet Huang Xiaoming cried more than anyone else The whole plot was completely incoherent Two people had no CP feeling Their emotional performance was very stiff It insulted novels and TV dramas Even if we knew the plot the screenwriter wouldnt fool the audience like this How could anyone go to the movie to insult the audiences IQ
0	What the hell is this
1	Ten thousand years is too long
1	I personally think the typical story of Stephen Chows unique painting style is very valuable
1	Beyond the expectations of Marvel superhero films many American talk shows have great laughs
0	What the hell
1	If you really want to raise the score of this film and want to smile before the end of the day you should support this film which has a smile point a plot context cheating tears and the national goddess although I admit that my smile point is still relatively low
1	In fact I didnt see the last point very clearly because tears blinded my sight

1	Love me don
1	I always think this kind of film is good
1	Its like a paper towel in a pile of shit When I came out of the cinema my friend asked me what kind of life I want in the film I said I want a brilliant life not lying at home with degenerated limbs The film is funny and ironic reflective and sad and there are people who support it Its worth the ticket price
1	Remember I like it after reading the evaluation

1	Its worth seeing
0	Its really a super perfunctory one Only the PK section of the airport can be seen Im sleepy before and after
0	The mausoleum is the visual sensation
1	Just to see if a person is doing something with his heart he will know that he is sitting happily between older children and children A crew who is tireless in his works instantly kills other films on the same schedule not for profit but to change the future of Chinese films not how to create a better box office but how to arouse more resonance Yes this era is not Lack of talents but lack of Heroes
1	I want to see the big screen with you I like the ending very much
1	Moms generation often disapproves of Stephen Chows works The funny and unreasonable plot seems to have no connotation In fact it seems that every line and plot contains a lot of themes about love for humanity As a director screenwriter and producer Xingye is a very commendable article in terms of creative stunts The version of Tang Monk sees a lot of Xingyes shadow but its a pity that the article and Shu Qis combination Its not as good as what Xingye and Zhu Yin felt ten years ago
1	I still like Stephen Chows banter style
0	A comedian can make a movie
1	Its really good
1	Julys mother said its hard for girls to go either way but I hope my daughter is an exception A film only shed tears here
1	A pure love song and dance film the last look back and look at each other with a smile is the sublimation of love Perhaps for the marriage life of pots and pans this is the best ending of love
1	Its very urgent Why didnt the support be in place when there should be support? I thought it was a rendering of the plot After reading a long review it seemed really hard However I personally feel that some actions are still lack of deployment such as catching a fugitive
1	Who says comedies cry from beginning to end
1	A very sincere work Except for the occasional special effects the accent is really good
1	Its a good occasion Im really happy Thats enough How happy the money is Hahaha
0	One for feelings and one for special effects
1	Dont be distracted humor like this boring laugh
1	Whats more Chinas conscience is not only a good thing for children to see but also a good place to sell There are no big deficiencies in the movie Actually at the very beginning I wanted to make complaints about the five big mountains and small hills in China Although there are many plagiarism in the use of the bridge it is totally worth the affirmation that the plot is closely contradictory The processing is also ingenious and very glaring but the rendering of 3D seems to have some problems and details Its very vague but keep trying
0	I wonder why the actors mouth and lines are completely wrong Its the sound of reading 123 in the early stage and matching it in the late stage And dont boast who has acting skills in this film Anyway I dont see that I only wanted to add one star to the star who is also cancer The female owner of the whole film is not as charming as Lin Yun Why do I use the best woman in her film Shu Qi has not appeared for three minutes
1	At first I sang and danced when I didnt agree with each other For a time I thought it was an Indian film but several long scenes surprised me When I was frustrated you encouraged me to start believing in hope again but how did we separate? Now I opened my club and you completed your dream If I chose you at that time how can I go through my life together? Too few people are glad to have met in this life and I will love you forever
0	Without Yao Chen we wouldnt have to make this movie
1	Im Iron Man
0	No culture is terrible
1	Some people can really pretend that B you say that the plot is not compact enough and the story is not ups and downs enough Play a star and say that the picture is ordinary What are the unusual pictures
1	Some people say that Charlottes trouble is that she gets so many praise because of her low expectation so this person must not have seen the film To be honest the theme of the film is not novel a little funny a little through a little touching a little youth but these add up to let everyone see herself If what is the greatest success of the film then the protagonist must be the most ordinary normal Charlotte is not the rich man in the youth film
1	I think its good What do I care about you
0	Its really from comics Its really a comics routine Dont shoot it
1	Too many highlights are the combination of pig Bajie and little dragon girl The character is so good that the baby is going to become the king of comedy
1	Its the smell of Xingye
1	The book I read in junior high school is changed into a movie My memory is not clear but I still feel very different from the original Instead the ending is reversed The dead people are in July Ma Sichun and Zhou Dongyu are great The deepest thing is that there is a person who can always write letters Today BEIBI watched a movie and had diarrhea twice loudy crying faceloudly crying faceloudly crying face
1	Typical of losers counter attack an undervalued film created the myth of Chinese film box office
1	Hu Bayi moved me to the original that all forms are appearances and only love is profound and true
1	The plot is very old-fashioned Jackie Chan is still working hard for four stars at his age
1	the appearance and disappearance of sth Destined
1	The five stars cant be any lower They should be released in 16 years We expect the second film to have renewed hope for mainland animation
1	I didnt expect Damien in the burst drummer Then I made such a film At the beginning the group dance really made me think it was a film that liked the youth of pop music and dance However in the last sixth I began to cry In addition to unprofessional singing and dancing and paying tribute to nostalgic films this film is to make people dream from a third perspective and make you wake up feeling deja vu but you can only choose the same dream and object
1	Its the first time in my life that I think Ill go to the cinema 2345 times Its too good
1	The first music was really amazing Later Wang Feng really surprised me
1	Those who violate China will be punished even if they are far away
0	Lets not talk about the familiar boss The mountain demons all look the same and collide with the European and American painting style Then there are the familiar spider man hacker empire Kung Fu Panda classic scenes and actions Set the characters emotional line and try to learn from the despicable me At the end the great saint is completely the open end of the monster company and I dont see much Im tired of copying others so badly Two stars were given to teacher Tong Zirong
1	Life is a journey We have experienced several reincarnations in exchange for this journey and this journey is very short Therefore we might as well be bold We might as well be bold to love a person climb a mountain and chase a dream There are many things I dont understand but I believe that one thing God sent us to this world is to let us create miracles The aestheticism of the picture is regarded as the subversion of two-dimensional animation and it hurts at last
1	The special effects are first-class the plot is chaotic and the rest is Marvel fans digging all kinds of colored eggs
1	Because the appearance of Golden Horse Award double egg yolk makes me cant wait to see this film I was moved by this youth film that people who step on the shadow will be together for a lifetime and people who step on their own shadow must live a happy life Many details can be afterthought and thought slowly
1	Keep working hard for the four stars Dont be proud
0	Why do I go to the cinema to see such a film
1	Although the special effects are unsatisfactory and there are many imitations the performance of Chinese magic theme is much better than the painting which is worth encouraging
0	The special effects are good but its too messy Tang monk is a big failure of the play
1	Give this pure film four and a half stars The song and dance film is not to your taste In addition the people around you are too noisy The story ending is vulgar See you again many years later See todays mutual fantasy It was possible yesterday If it was possible the people around you might be you welcome to SEBS watching hand light skin tone
1	Its very moving and a little embarrassing
0	The hard work of one star foundation is divided into one star and the beauty of the picture is divided Theres nothing left The plot is shit All the love is inexplicable Even the dubbing is collective violation and Ji Guanlin is not saved Its too big to hear I only treat you as my brother even when Im a Pisces bitch
0	Fifty cents special effect three cents script Lu Chuan are you out of your mind
1	At least with your heart
1	Dreamers who believe in love like this name very much Its very classical
1	Xu Zheng is too poor
0	The so-called laugh point density is actually to cater to the tastes of the current audience From the perspective of story structure it is slightly stereotyped In the sense of appreciation the theme sublimation is not in place
1	I never regarded you as love The fleeting freshness really tempted me I still remember talking about the future one year later I still wanted to insist
1	American children are still a little tasteful
1	Both music and dance and the imperfect love between men and women are very beautiful Valentines day cant be spent with her husband On February 11 people who watched the movie theater were full and gave 4 points because the rhythm in the middle was too slow
1	Very good I want to see it again
1	No 1 compact frame supported by appearance value  but the beauty teams appearance value is really high
1	He is our hero
1	There are so few films but its the only one I want to brush two and three for it At the beginning I just came back with the mentality of looking at it but I really want Amway From my attitude towards this film and my childhood I have made clear the attribute of my circle of friends monkey
1	What a qualified new years comedy It was a happy and happy 100 minutes
1	Its pretty good I want to go to Thailand
1	There is always a feeling that it is not in place
1	Ridiculous but the laughter is enough
1	Huian Dadi cinema
0	Whose youth is not youth
0	Rotten film
0	Im so sleepy crying face
1	Its worthy of Jackie Chans yelling for so long There are a lot of jokes outside the plot For example when the overseas students played by Chen Bolin leave the country the girls in the back row shout big brother and the tone and tone of coco always make me think its Marxs chaotic harem shouting which is too similar to me
0	The plot is very chaotic I feel like Im sleepy in the middle of the edited part
1	As a fake Marvel powder 5-star mindless fight is impeccable as a special effect combat actor in a commercial film There are still many disputes Obviously marvel wants to find an appropriate reason for both teams and the audience still unconsciously loves one party Personally I think its right to ignore all processes and means and the bill cant sign the US team The winter soldier should forgive the iron man for being too paranoid The revenge Panther can be released lower hatred
1	Those who spray the captain dont like the winter soldiers Theres no need to explain whether I sit and see the last minute spider or dont restart This hero really cant afford to be destroyed
1	I didnt have a sense of music I was brushed by the play and finally gave up the live broadcast of Sansheng III I went to see the film with my friends Its a bit like a Disney cartoon I began to sing when I didnt say a word The opening is amazing I cant sit still in my seat and think of singing and dancing The story is more interesting as a whole I dont like many scenes very much Its very beautiful Its like the performance of the fairyland lady on earth She was the best hostess at the 89th Academy Awards
0	Its a movie for Mr He and Li Yifeng but to tell you the truth theres no plot in this movie I dont know what its about Its selfie who supports the whole play
0	There is no good thing for those who sell feelings Refer to small age Warcraft
1	Tap water you won Its an all-weather bombing Amway The only regret I have is the Cantonese version
0	Inspirational and positive energy actually appear in the commonly used labels of short films These days inspirational and positive energy are really worthless However except for the male actress Wei daxun its OK Compared with his appearance this film can compete with the same period of small age 4
0	ha-ha
1	Ha ha ha ha but I dont like men and women
1	When love passes through the whole city the fool who pursues the dream is shining The dream can start again but love is no longer missed When one day all is realized but only love is lost will the original firmness waver a little at a certain moment? Will you fantasize about another choice? But how far can love go without the light of the dream? I will love you forever The last look was to thank each other for their success
1	As soon as master fan appeared the whole rotten film raised more than one grade As for Su Shis jokes that have no connotation they apply to everyone
1	Chunqu qiulai Begonia flowers bloom
1	In the end we all became people we didnt want to be
0	No more ugly thank you
1	This is the price of dreams There is no if
1	The most handsome black baby appeared
1	I didnt expect that the choice of casual viewing was quite wonderful  there were a lot of laughter sometimes it was like a drama scene  finally if it werent for being in the cinema I would cry face with tears of Joy I think Yuan Hua is a bit like Zhang Zhilin New moon face
0	Chinese humor makes people speechless If you watch sketches on TV every time you will be helpless to all the old stems in the film
0	Do you think its better to make a big fuss in Tianzhu when I fall asleep
1	Not bad
1	Consistent Jackie Chan style 
1	It is said that he is still quite loyal to the original
0	I hope Lu Chuan will stop making movies in the future
1	Its not bad Its much better than the mermaid Its also more comfortable I just think theres a little less new music in it
0	Egg force
1	Beautiful reality
1	Movies that laugh and cry are really like sketches but I hate sensationalism when watching sketches I feel very moved when crying today I dont understand technical things but good movies can make you feel a lot after watching them leaving a lot of thoughts on the way back Walking in the community is very happy
1	I know its good without looking at the poster Dasheng is handsome and has updated the desktop
0	My husband and I really didnt look good in the cinema and blew me cold in the summer
1	Such a hot film must be watched Its very funny The baby is still a mindless person in the film The addition of Huang Bo makes the film more colorful and funnier than when it was first won
1	Making domestic animated films like this really brightens my eyes Although the plot is a little incoherent it is really good for conscience production
0	Absurd three views
1	To tell you the truth from the perspective of comedy I dont think its funny When I watch it I have a tangled feeling of watching the star work hard but not being poked; But the film is still very imaginative The plot of the whole film is compact and makes people follow up step by step Many comrades can testify that coke popcorn is still intact after the film ends Of course it may also be stunned
1	The theme song city of stars is really wasteful The plot of the play is very good but the music is a little bad
1	In any case there are several places that are really addicted to including Tsui Harks bizarre and exaggerated style Xingyes nonsense and deep meaning good and evil true and false their own arrangements and the Cantonese version of the lines Ah so the four stars can also be
1	I dont like the supporting actress Daliang The five-star picture and feelings are all memorable but the plot Qius grandparents ferry people They all have a story of up and down 500 years but let the Phoenixs crane haired and childlike Old God priest These noble images are only tired of Chuns love and gratitude I always feel that there is a trace of wrong displeasure moved by Qiu
1	Its nice to make the main melody like this
1	Special effects forget the plot 
1	it s not bad
1	I think I can also be sun Dasheng
1	I dont know what the psychology of the people who give this film 1 star 2 stars and 3 stars is They say that the quality of domestic garbage is not good every day Now there is a quality that can be said that all kinds of bad animation Do you really want to be like the general mobilization of Autobots? You dont support domestic animation but dont blindly BB support liangxinman to resist inferior animation
1	Its better than the films that you and I cant help now There are too many good films of truth goodness and beauty which are of great practical significance I believe children will give them when they see them Cherish the feelings between people
1	After all this is our superhero We can recognize superheroes Who can refuse our great saint? Its full of great saints who are different from their childhood Superheroes change and explode into the sky in an instant
0	I dont want to give a star Its wrong to talk about values What movies
1	Although the plot is not much new it is enough to start an animated film After all the monkey king is the only hero in China This film should be the best animated film in China at present
0	I want to say that its garbage Garbage How bad Yao Chen and Tang Yan have eyes
1	Although there is no big talk the journey to the west is touching but it is also the work of Xingyes sincerity What moved me was Chai Jings interview with Xingye The silver haired Xingyes eyes were dim Things are right and people are wrong
1	I think its OK but the actors are a little amateur
1	Special effect good story slag
0	The plot of the story is too chaotic I dont know what to say It has a beginning and an end Its very chaotic in the middle A good fairy story is made into a three-level edge film of love Its so rough that its a waste of money that its not suitable for the cinema
0	Its really far worse than a movie I almost fell asleep at the premiere
1	Its good to make domestic films like this
1	Marvel favorite
1	I really love the journey to the West I accept it except that I really dont understand why the nine headed bird wants to fight against the exorcism trio Even I hope to keep shooting Its my own selfishness It depends on other friends
0	The film tastes so strange it has to play deep and heavy tastes and it has to shake the burden Its really worrying If this is the first episode of the series I wont play with it at all
0	Its all a fragmented plot
1	The whole process is easy to burn without urine Zhang Hanyu Peng YuYans acting skills are online
1	it s not bad
1	Good looking the plot is very clear
1	It felt good Huang Bo felt like a fire cloud evil god when he came out
0	With all due respect its OK to paint However the plot makes me look confused Chihiro is also a variety of development but the story logic of others makes people feel very natural However this development is too chaotic the plot is far fetched and with all kinds of forced atmosphere isnt it a rotten film
1	Still sincere
1	There are some complex narratives The scenes are too beautiful Its not a crude film The theme is very positive The music is too classic I like affectionate handsome and talented men When I realize my dream and stand in the spotlight I hope the people around me are still you 
0	I dont think there are many common laughs and there is nothing good to see
0	Someone you come out and talk about your experience of watching movies Its not only very beautiful but also very beautiful
1	Its still a very easy and funny film It made a super good box office Its very happy but it doesnt seem to reach my G-point so its 4 stars
1	A good movie must have five stars
1	I dont want to say more about big brothers film In fact I dont need to make more comments but I still cant help saying that big brother is really old Of course this has nothing to do with the film but some regrets that time has passed by inadvertently
1	The high-level happiness in a relationship is mutual achievement not mutual binding and imprisonment in the name of love
1	The plot is generally given high marks mainly because it is Yan Kong The whole play is my love of beauty Da Mi Mi and little peach
1	The effect of red silk cloak is really amazing
1	Ive seen it twice Im going to be powdered by Marvel circle
1	Looking at an animation that has been fired high on the Internet before is also an animation that has experienced a lot of hardships Looking at the last long list of people we know that it is really worth encouraging to make such animation in China but there is still a lot of room for improvement but I hope not to stop and produce more and better animation in the future
1	Origin of national movement
1	I think the stunts are really great I dont know if someone manipulated me to watch movies I have a good taste in entertainment and leisure If you want to see the logically rigorous Spring Festival Gala and the Great Wall Wulitou doesnt need to explain his logic to you I feel that no one wants to pass a ticket with you What you say you owe what you dont owe ha ha
1	Make complaints about the adorable hero Spiderman
1	Here to the ones who dream football as they may see there to the hearts that ache here to the MES we make
1	At least its much more interesting than a mermaid
1	Bloody violence parents who take their children to see it regret it After watching this film they immediately feel that it is very special and necessary to implement Chinese film classification as soon as possible
1	Cherish your happy life
1	So am I an Sheng or July 
1	The clothes of sister stone in each frame are different The man looks handsome when he plays the piano seriously Im going to dig the work to see the ending YY and the kiss The ending is still the same forever Its sad
1	Clear thinking is better than the appearance of outstanding special effects characters Everyone has his own ideas What is different is the perspective of things
1	The plot is simple but more creative and the animation production is excellent Look forward to the sequel
1	Is the screenwriter an alpaca? And the spider man eggs on the Internet are fake
1	Domestic cartoons are getting better and better which is worth encouraging
1	In fact 6 is a normal score and more than 8 is a little false even if it is more than one star
1	A story of everything going well will not be moving at all Only by photographing the regret and the fragility of love can we gain real comfort when we get out of the cinema
0	I wanted to ignore the content of patriotic education and watch the play directly I didnt expect it
1	Xingye and master bless special effects cool actor acting skills online Wukong doesnt want the traditional monkey to be more like a personal master silly Meng Although he doesnt have martial arts he has excellent EQ and knows how to appease three murderers Zhu Bajie was handsome by contrast when he changed The most wonderful thing is that he never knows who the big boss is Miss Duan is the obsessive mass actor of Tang monk The film is also a highlight The film is full of wonderful laughter
0	Im sorry my expectation of the three views of the film is simply touching If it were the hope of Chinese animated films how bad would Chinese animated films be? Human men originally wanted to be kind to save people but they turned this kindness into selfish harmed classmates The displaced women were to repay their kindness Returning the mans life hurt Qiu Why dont I say to take responsibility when I go? Returning Qius life is disgusted by this touching three views in the cinema
1	I like a line in the movie only when there is pain can we know the pain of all sentient beings; when there is persistence let go of persistence; when there is concern there is no concern; this is a realm and I am just an ordinary person This should be the reason why Tang Seng cant let Miss Duan go and cant fall in love with Xiaoshan The cooperation between the two major directors makes the film more perfect The actors are also very surprising Some details in the film need to be excavated The fine works will be painted more times
1	Xiaotian cried when he died Peng Yuyan was very handsome Those children were too scary Their nerves were tight until the end of the film
1	Im not so disgusted with Peng Yuyan In order to catch those drug lords alive so many brothers were killed and injured Alas my rabbit still dare not walk sideways Im afraid it will make people talk I emphasize that we must catch them alive and plead guilty after trial in order to prove our reputation When my father considered catching bin Laden alive he always killed them directly I say youre guilty youre guilty International public opinion condemns me as a bird My rabbit still needs to keep hiding his power and biding his time  
0	Two stars one for Qiu and one for master Miyazaki The main line of the story is a mess There is no bright spot in the mermaid love festival Inexplicable love Inexplicable stories are not only inexplicable but also very lengthy
1	Distracted hello
1	Fragrance
1	Five years later I fantasize about life again It is because of this ending that I like this film
1	Like a mirror I live like you You follow my footsteps The moment Ma Sichun looks up in the snow he seems to see Fujiis short haired girl How beautiful
1	Zeng Guoxiang has a surprise
1	Rationally speaking this film is not a good work There are too many shortcomings Its too obvious I dont know what the ghost story is The painting style is set with all kinds of shadows of Hayao Miyazaki but it doesnt have the depth of others However Im still very surprised The scene is quite shocking the music is good and the ancient Chinese style is very delicious Although I dont understand why I should be sick in 3D I should enjoy watching movies sometimes Dont worry Controlled by the outside world
1	Goslings piano is really good Sister stones expression is too rich The feeling of long lens and musical is too much like bird man The end is very wonderful That series of fantasies is completed at one go especially sister stones smile containing everything in heaven and earth
0	I didnt watch it
1	The US team is the best series made by marvel Well except for US team 1
0	Xingye and Xu Ke were my favorite directors and actors Xinlongmen Inn and the king of comedy watched it over and over again but Im sorry to hit a star
1	Its a little out of control in the middle There are many bright spots on the whole Its good
1	Love Tony
1	Life is actually very simple Good and bad are relative It depends on how you understand it
1	For the first time I felt that the domestic comedy was so funny
1	celebrate the New Year
1	Its still funny but the plot is a little stiff
1	Conscience is like a river You must be alive
1	Love Nini so gay friends are still old okay
1	Special effects are well done and in line with international standards
1	Great director Lin Chao Xian Zhang Hanyu Eddie Peng Sun Chun Chen Baoguo Feng Wenjuan Liu Xianda Zhao Jianwu Chinese mainland Hongkong Chinese Mandarin Cantonese Thai Burmese and English
1	If I finally lose you I still have a dream dont I? Thank you for becoming my inspiration and becoming a part of me
1	Returning to nature as a dream is a surprise and regret in life
1	All living beings know their pain only when they have had pain They have been persistent They have let go of persistence They have been concerned They have no worries it is worthy of being the work of Shuangwang It is full of laughter and heart piercing Wu Yifan is very impressive
0	Neither painful nor itching nor the 2013-03-21 Stephen Chows sensitivity makes the movie full of emotional appeal The story is full of humor through the allusion and the desire to follow the vulgar line is too much for the most time The scene of the pig suck is a bright spot
1	Crying laughing and crying
1	Charlotte is funny but she doesnt think its funny after she walks out of the cinema Its all one-time funny points
0	Dont support domestic bad dramas
1	The best this year
1	16510 Bengbu Wanda
1	I think its very beautiful They realized their dreams He played songs that only she could understand They are far away There are so many perfect fairy tales Its good to realize their dreams in reality Thats still very sad
1	good-looking
0	Why do the reviews of the bean paste become more and more water? The 5 stars are so many but the story LOW is good enough to explode But Sun Wukongs people are too two Ma face you are not mistaken Its a horse face I bet Liuxiaolingtong will make complaints about Liuxiaolingtongs visit to Liuxiaolingtongs version of the journey to the West Whats more Liuxiaolingtong can give us a real Sun Wukong and rest
1	We cant accept and understand that the IP of a journey to the west is invincible No one feels it every year Whats more most people still cant accept this preconceived image of the TV version of journey to the west which is more human than divine It has a far-reaching impact
1	Yes the shooting technique is very professional which adds highlights to the film Its no wonder that the director is Chen Kexin
1	Ill always be team Ironman I like Robert Downeys performance so much I like Tony
1	This is to see it with the little one who has been in love for many years Goodbye In the old time the whole horror film in the front the middle of the forest robbing Xuanzang was really funny The ending of the general martial arts fantasy Its said that the shape of the goblin is really ugly Many lines and actions and the overall atmosphere are very Xingyes theater but I always think Huang Bos monkeys are really bad Its funny and unreasonable to watch movies at a critical moment happy
0	And the Dragon hunting strategy is not at all a grade Look at the way people make complaints about the dragon
1	Special effect burning and frying has no disadvantages except Wu Yifan
0	There is no climax in the whole process This play is the level of middle school students composition
1	Satisfy all fantasies about love and just fantasies
1	Isnt it just a simple core that true love is around? How can it be interpreted as three outlooks? The screenwriter is ill and deliberately outputs three outlooks

0	The fragmented film version of the story tells us that the TV version is not the worst
1	Mrs spider is so cute Steamed stuffed buns are so cute There are a lot of jokes in the first half and abuse Nini Originally the US team decided to stand in iron man
1	It turns out that love can end like this
0	Terminal stage of straight male cancer
1	Its much better than the second one
1	Last special surprise
1	Beautiful picture deep and secluded artistic conception Unfortunately its embarrassing not to tell the story well The narrator has committed dialogue Its inexplicable The main line of the story is messy the plot jumps out of the story background and the world outlook is scattered Its like eating in Michelin five-star restaurant and finding several flies in the food
1	At least in the cinema
1	Although the trace of plagiarism is still obvious it is very good from music to storyline and characterization
1	Recently Hong Kong films are OK although there is no breakthrough in the plot
1	The expectation is very low but its unexpectedly good-looking Ive seen the film review I heard that the original work has a high degree of restoration great special effects and some laughs Then I grabbed a special ticket 188 for the four stars
1	Im satisfied to see the film of Xingye
0	Such a high score can only show that Chinas loser consumer group is huge
1	Its true that every time I watch such a fierce scene Im worried that my heart will be unbearable I dont know what effect this film will have on the staff of the drug treatment center
0	In this way you can get more than 8 points Doublan really ruined it
0	I cant tell stories and make any movies
1	Five stars because I went to see it with my male God 
1	The main funny point of RT is that Wang Baoqiang fell into the water Its so funny
1	Those who love Xingye will understand Those who dont love Xingye dont have to ask for more
1	Ive been looking forward to a funny movie
0	NMB can I swear
1	How to say? I havent had such a dense smile for a long time I laugh a lot and dont understand those professional comments
1	Personally I think its good Although it doesnt look like spider man what kind of man looks powerful but I like the hero Hey hey 
1	True story adaptation of anti drug Mekong case
1	Compared with too embarrassing in the same period its worth going to the cinema
1	Tears streaming down my face after reading it
1	The picture is really good The transformation of Dasheng into a handsome BGM is highly praised but the modeling of Dasheng is a little ugly
0	Fortunately I just read it as the background sound when doing housework Otherwise how can I afford this more than an hour
1	Smile with tears look very happy
1	The level of the film deviates from the level of his box office It just coincides with the good time for the release of the new year There are no other comedies and powerful American blockbusters to create the box office miracle of the film The joke is relatively low which is not as embarrassing as people
1	Both advantages and disadvantages
1	Genuine and serious attitude
1	Although the soundtrack and jokes of the work of conscience and sincerity can be said to pay too much tribute to the classics and show the shadow of plagiarism the overall shortcomings are not hidden Because it is quite excellent it has an unpleasant feeling
1	The classic works of domestic films are excellent in music
1	Cherish the present people
0	Lu Chuan you have lost the possibility of the rise of my only Chinese element film I can make a film 10 times better than you for 100000 yuan so I dont know what you directors mean to call themselves directors
0	Only Na Yings song is good
0	The authors imagination was ruthlessly destroyed by the director
1	I dont think its so funny but Im very sad
1	Popcorn chips are not a burden
1	On July 16 I went to the cinema to see 3D The special effects are very good which is better than joy I dont know how many times the painting style is also very good The only fatal injury is the thin plot
1	The great sage came back and wept with joy I would like to brush the red cloak to the end of the world
0	The first time the film was still on I came to evaluate it huh
0	Shu Qi is really beautiful Lin Yun is also beautiful and Wu Yifans appearance is also a proper acting skill
1	In my opinion calling big fish Begonia a masterpiece may be exaggerated but it is by no means a rotten film among many people This work seriously wants the audience to feel some Chinese culture inherited for thousands of years and some elements between people I cant help thinking of the past two Chinese cartoons Xiaoqian and Baolian lamp I feel that these are some feelings belonging to the Chinese people which will still be moved even if they spread for thousands of years
1	You fight before you finish your words The United States team and Tony really have a strong CP feeling Tony and Thor show each other how promising their girlfriends are Eagle eye has a family Shocked this pain that directly touches everyones heart is easy to catch Especially when the widowed sister sees her past she feels distressed Its not easy to escape with the doctor in spring The doctor disappeared The witch is so handsome and has a good voice Brother silver Brother Bento cant look directly at the phantom face
1	The laughter of all the children in the audience How can I be an aunt
0	To make complaints about rotten
1	Make you laugh no matter what the movie says or not the truth of life is worth the ticket price
1	I began to fall asleep and then I saw tears collapse
1	Can make you laugh so impertinently in front of strangers What else do you want
1	10 points
1	Good looking is good-looking Spring Festival movies Its amazing to see this special effect The plot is also suitable for playing one star and two star watercress to force the young people to go back to your mother
1	moving
1	Not bad
1	At 211 oclock every song is super pleasant to listen to Dancing simply arouses blood surging The story of the whole film is very simple and ordinary The long song and dance until the end simply pushes the story to the extreme They are all pursuing legend It is not a legend Everyday can also bring such touching and shaking On the importance of the end
0	greatly disappointed
0	The sequel is hopeless
1	Life is so hard Its too hard to get real freedom
1	First of all from the beginning of the havoc in heaven the whole 3D and art are good and the overall structure is quite decent which is a great progress In addition the bad soundtrack is poor in art as a whole and the narration is limited to one frame which is a little stiff In summary the 3D version can give 754 stars
1	Good good special effects Although Tangtang appeared later the performance was pretty good

There are three original theme songs promoted in the early stage and who is invited to match the sound

0	Is my smile getting higher and higher? Why do I think this film is so funny?

Every choice is right even if you think it is wrong it is still the same wrong to go back

1	I love the United States team smiling face
1	Its very thought-provoking
1	The performance of chasing dreams is a masterpiece and the performance of love is a failure especially the five years left blank at the end From the results I can only infer that the female owner is not very care and there is no regret
0	It not only expresses the calculation proficiency of every Chinese but also is always in an invincible moral position After 90 minutes it repeats the boring fight and the face of the Savior but the whole film is qualified commercial production
0	A losers YY three outlooks are not right I really cant get the point of the film but Xihong city really laughs at me

0	Huang Xiaoming used to look handsome but now his temperament is becoming more and more obscene
1	For the first time in so many years domestic animated films make me feel like watching Nezha in the sea but it still seems immature in artistic expression Of course we should encourage people to go back to where they are which shows that this direction is right
1	Love is the greatest power
1	Love and kill each other is more thought-provoking than the original work Zhou Dongyus acting skills are recognized again
1	It deserves to be the best 3D animated film in China
0	Once again it proves that Wu Yifans film is ignored directly
1	I havent seen a movie for a long time Finally the American team wont lose relieved Face the superhero rally is a double harvest of love and foundation [bye] and Baji abuse me Is it really appropriate for little Downey [bye] the return of the little spider is a little thin The muscles of the US team pulling the plane with one hand are about to burst face screaming in The moment the ant man got bigger I thought Altman was in a mess Ha ha ha ha it looks good

1	Bloody fights and gun battles are fierce the enemy is cunning and the battle is hard However this is only a film The real anti drug fight will only be more bloody cruel and difficult It is because some people take drugs so the drug trade is repeated and the border drug trafficking is rampant Countless anti drug police take their lives to fight for films Let me strengthen my personal resistance to drug abuse directors and actors In addition the domestic film classification system is very necessary for parents not to take them Is it OK for such a young child to see it
1	The first time I saw IMAX for the five stars it exploded The opening was a big play The red witch was so beautiful Okay? When Frey appeared in the big plane of team 2 he was crying The narrative was smooth and well paved He could shoot such a grand framework well He also took into account the brain damage of each protagonist which means that it is worth the ticket price

1	Its capricious from beginning to end
1	Cherish the person in front of you love letter
1	The picture is very exquisite The process of love in the retro style at the beginning is sweet and lively I never like song and dance dramas and they are also integrated into the music in the film Each capital is just right The plot is very complete and organized The directors picture is handled very well beautiful and true Many scenes are oil paintings I didnt expect the ending to be separated but the final assumption makes up for the regret a little lead a person to endless aftertastes

1	I really cant watch the embarrassing attack in Hong Kong Except for listening to the old song string fever I didnt have any surprise and couldnt laugh I had great expectations But after I heard about this film on the Venus show I completely forgot the release of the film I didnt think of it I didnt expect to give full marks as a comedy
0	This is the over consumed brand and appeal Its worth affirming that there are still some funny stems but some places are a little vulgar The special effects are too heavy Has the bridge section of selling corruption become the selling point of the box office? I think if selling corruption cant achieve a good comic effect why do you deliberately do it? In fact I want to give a star but aim at Lin Yuns chest and one Lets add another one to the viewer
1	Although I have always warned myself not to expect too much it is still too high з」 ∠ but its also funny Its just the degree of numbness in your face PS the moment after reading the mark is exactly 000 Hello in 2013
1	Ten thousand years is too long 1818
1	It is a work of heart It is a rare high-quality domestic comedy in recent years

1	Its so funny Its funny and tearful
0	I cant be blind Zhao Youting doesnt cry and cant act Cui Ping appeared twice in looking for a gun at the beginning and end It seems that its really a white man blaming others by director Jiang Wenting
1	Much better than the war wolf
0	After watching the so-called miracle Im so angry Miracles are bought with the innocent lives of others Others have tried their best to fight for you This kind of Mary Surrey story of eating shit really tarnishes some beautiful and exquisite pictures or please dont murder the so-called love and feelings with beautiful pictures
1	Heavy taste should not be included in the new years film but the film is good
0	Just those actors are not interested in watching
1	Its really good-looking and the special effects are great There are a lot of people in the cinema old and young Its very funny Its very easy to watch the whole film on holidays The interpretation of each role is very good that is its innovative and respects the original work In short it feels very good Pay tribute to Xingye and director Xu
1	Good for funny movies
1	On the self-cultivation of spare tire TT although the lines of spare tire are poor
1	I will turn into the wind and rain in the world to accompany you
1	The last part was too pretentious and failed
0	At the beginning I thought it was a typical disgusting toad YY swan meat Charlotte became a singer and the school flower became like that I didnt like it The overall feeling was that I didnt like it
1	When I was about to return to the world I looked at the time and the only feeling was its over? The picture is beautiful the background setting is very grand and the mood is very quiet The story is very clean So some shocking points are seen Other reviews make complaints about the mistakes of the Tun and the payment of the fetters and the companions of the fallows may be a good idea So I just want to Tucao since emotion is so reserved lets not talk about such modern lines
1	The plot trend is very tense which stimulates Peng Peng to look good in everything and his acting skills are worth the ticket price Recently several domestic dramas have exceeded the expectations of domestic standards It has to be said that it is something worth celebrating
1	Tell us that the most cherished thing is often the people and things around you that you ignore True love is around you Its funny but also moving
0	I didnt understand why so many people praised me a while ago Today some people say that I have strange taste Anyway this film gives me the feeling of vulgarity As for the smile I watched it with dinner and my roommate didnt poke it at all
1	Before watching it I doubt whether it is really as good as the comments After watching it I think it is the best domestic police and bandit action film made so far
1	1 didnt finish watching 2 It seems that it doesnt have a say in the comparison of the two films If 2 alone I think its OK Big scenes and big actions one by one I dont have a special feeling about such films In general its worth the ticket money
1	The conscience work of domestic animation is that Wukong is a little ugly
1	Not everyone in the navy has their own right and wrong judgment criteria Everyone has their own feelings and experience Dont follow the trend and dont follow others I give full marks to the music picture scene Some people say its vulgar Anyway I think its very moving Its like having a dream Guoman has hope
1	Although the rare work of conscience is not enough to encourage the Lord the ending is hard to pull back to he which is somewhat abrupt I just want to say that you have hung up teachers and disciples and all kinds of immortality in the whole process
1	The brand of ten years girlfriends is more profound than anything The friendship between girls is a mixture of love friendship and family affection We may have different characters but are closely stitched together by invisible needles and threads Occasionally we envy occasionally hate and occasionally envy the one I know best I have seen you that others dont know I know the pain under your arrogance I know the depression and luck under your cleverness Youre lucky to have you
1	Good looking is that you are familiar with the plot plus a little surprise The old-fashioned ending of the previous plot is a little surprised but this ending mobilizes all my memories of the past In real life it is not that lovers get married and fly together which resonates with the audience
1	What you meet is the best
1	I just like Stephen Chows unrestrained imagination
1	The journey to the west is the story of Wukong and subduing the devil is the story of Xuanzang I saw the Tang Monk nagging and subduing the devil to show Xuanzangs compassion The love between Wukong and Xuanzang is the same Zixia and Miss Duan the Exorcist are completely the same kind of people The article is very good This one is not inferior to the classic
1	IMAX in Longshan Seoul was still full on Friday afternoon None of the best Marvel films Ive ever seen so far Ant man and spider man contracted the laughter of the whole film
1	Thats really cool Lao Meis stunts are not cool
1	There are a lot of natural laughs Although dreams are a little common as many comments say they think that they should express that each level of life has its own troubles Fortunately their unhappiness lies in their own state of mind

1	Good looking old stem renovation but interesting through a new dream a smile dense but not vulgar and interesting
1	Actually I like that purple girl very much
1	Fan Bingbing is quite clever
1	The routine is very old but Im still used to it Every young man can find his own shadow and resonate with it I feel that Im stupid but I always want to say that Im afraid no one will listen so I havent said it Slowly even I began to doubt that it was too childish and meaningless until I found that it was the most precious voice in life
1	Seeing the progress of Chinese animation it is no longer the Wumao special effect The picture is very beautiful and the plot is still weak
1	Seriously dont blow bull B patriotic to defend the Diaoyu Islands Just fucking learn from stark Blow bull B on the Internet and smash his citizens things
1	When selfish people call the name of justice the world will be in a fucking mess Whats the matter with my brother killing your parents? Dont think were colleagues I wont kill you if were not friends Whats the matter with your brother? Besides its none of my business to die And the screenwriter Dont you know something you cant say?

0	 did Lu Chuan take this film while masturbating
1	Xu Zhengs films are funny and must be pursued
1	As a small film fan of marvel this play is not too disappointed Its just that the black widows play is too few The American team and iron man love each other and kill each other too much I love my winter soldier
0	Such a pretentious acting such a shameless scum man also said that he couldnt think of a balanced score There were too many sailors
1	The embarrassment of waiting for colored eggs has been committed
1	Crying twice is a Qiuqiu scene each frame is wallpaper and each scene is so beautiful that points are reduced Its left for the plot to abuse dog blood Qiuqiu is too crazy Come on Ill give you a hug for one night To tell you the truth although the male leader is Kun I want to say that Chunqiu is a bamboo horse Plus true love Kun is just kindness that saves Chun not love ah ah ah heartache Im qiu60 seconds
1	As a military action film it can be regarded as a thrilling film with good viewability but it is stiff and high at the end Obviously it is in another dilemma How many events have been restored and how many are adapted
1	Its so beautiful
0	Obviously everyone didnt take medicine
1	The skills and rhythm are skilled a bit like a commercial film Xu Zheng can soon replace ge you once a year Feng Xiaogang the worlds no hero will become famous It would be better if he blended with the Thai Tourism Bureau to have more scenery Its a pity that Thailand is not strong now
1	The plot is thin Wang Feng BGM plays   the picture production is touching and QAQ likes the expression of Da Sheng which cant get rid of the Hollywood model
0	One star to Li Yifeng and one star to Guangzhou
0	Its very sleepy but its very noisy However this kind of film will still be watched in the cinema because if I go home to watch it I cant help turning it off In addition I really like New York compared with California
1	Xu thought it was very funny because he skipped work
1	Everyone is an artist but you dont know it yet
1	The theme is still AI The overall feeling is still in place The special Tucao twins make complaints about their love
1	Its a little different from what I expected Personally I think the song and dance part is a little more but its still a good film
1	Slobber make complaints about plot struggle Great considering the nature of superheroes different ideas are natural So its not like civil war for the civil war But super heros Irrationality makes people want to talk about it Its a great day Facing the grass root and the black widow the spiderman is really suitable for playing the cock wire route 2333
1	Shanhaijingqiu a good film cant just watch the simple love triangle There are more things worth pondering about this film Dont follow the trend and see it in person before you know that the colored egg at the end is a special highlight of this film The second half of the film is blind
1	People who havent seen bad movies are following the trend and saying who is bad

1	As far as domestic animation films are concerned they are unexpectedly praised 3D technology is rigid and funny When they are not artificial xiaopenyou laughs Although the plot is relatively weak the final climax is burning but it is too short and perfunctory BGM is somewhat abrupt and lacks originality but it is really a conscience and hope in the depressed domestic animation industry We must encourage such brazen play than what Autobots always mobilize More than a thousand times better

1	Maybe its because as the producer said about 30 minutes of the play was deleted I dont think the plot is particularly coherent The transformation of Da Sheng is a little stiff and the end is too hasty However these defects still cant be shaken I think this is the best domestic animation Ive seen in recent years I hope the domestic animation team can make more good works

1	Despite the original work the plot of this film is also rotten but the scene with monster special effects is really good Compared with several films in the same period it is a conscience The domestic film is ruined by remaking a novel Several stars seem to have gone through a cut and the details at the end of the film are also great That is the protagonist is not as good as the supporting role
0	This TM is very embarrassing boring and insincere Ji Guanlin who has seen many of her dubbing plays has no sincerity
1	The first point I saw big fish cry was the tree made by grandpa In order to protect the female owner from the fire well my point of cry was very strange It seemed that I didnt stop my tears I was easily affected by emotion but it was true that as many curses said his plot could really start and predict the end after a while but I want to say that the film is really a visual and auditory enjoyment just music and animation effects Do I really want to praise or like it very much

They didnt break up directly and they may still be together for a long time but the hostess later became a well-known actor Their life trajectories became different reproducing the scene when the male hostess went on a tour Therefore they began to break up again and finally broke up The film only showed the most prominent contradictions but each time it was a condensed version of countless quarrels

1	Laugh to death ha ha ha ha its another substrate
1	Some special effects scenes look a little short of money but they are still very visual They are not ghost fans So for me this is a new loophole in the story narrative Its OK to circle the end Those actors who want to go to the movies should not go to variety shows in the future otherwise they will be mentally disabled after a long time and they will not only attack one person
1	Funny films are the most familiar things around but they cant laugh later
1	Handsome but its different from what I imagined Is it to prove that the spirit must surpass technology? I like iron man even more
1	3 brush to see the details of the special effects and review Its not as inexplicably moved as the first time The favorite fight is the chain when the great saint comes out and the mountain demon by the river cant understand that chaos cant throw the ball and collapse the place during the showdown and the magnificent dragon when the great saint comes back is very sensitive and the sound matching is OK 3D is good so I regret not watching avatar and juvenile school Its said that the special effects are very good The first attention ticket Housing and evaluation cant help registering for praise
1	In fact if you really say it you dont mean its really much especially good-looking but its not too much to say that he is one of the domestic animation in recent years The plot is simple and the ending is hasty but the victory is sincerity The picture is well made and the special effects are commendable Of course there are still deficiencies but this is a great progress of Guoman Its really burning for the four stars and the remaining one is to cheer for the Guoman production industry

1	Get Xiaotian back quickly Drugs can be more vicious drug dealers
0	The picture musicians drawing praised the story arrangement and the story arrangement was extremely poor 3D inexplicable The story itself was no problem but the directors ability to tell the story was too poor The plot was basically zero The rigid characters could not explain clearly Many characters and the plot were simply weak In the end I didnt understand the connection between raising a fish and the abnormal climate in the village Where was the second mans God set different and in charge of the laws of nature Why cant the village resist the flood
1	Looking at how tears filled her eyelashes when she smiled A good article was indeed excavated by the directors comedy talent The first time I thought you were handsome if it wasnt the birds nest hair or the shiny bald head its better to say that this young lady is too popular Shes tough outside and soft inside Shes always pitiable Huang Bo didnt say much about the most brilliant acting Recently youre very hot You love in your life even if it is Cover cant cover your edge
1	I dont know what the mentality of those who play one star is Regardless of their feelings it may be worth 3-4 stars but because the production team doesnt give up and perfunctory because it allows me to see some new hope because it successfully brings back my childhood heroes I give 5 stars high praise
1	Want to see
1	I saw a video a long time ago The little girl received her mothers birthday gift In addition to her schoolbag she also had a long-awaited trip to Disneyland She couldnt believe the excited crying The last paragraph of Thai embarrassment contained this particularly wonderful emotion This play made me laugh with tears It really deserves its reputation and looks good

1	The real action team with no urine spots in the whole process and almost no aura of the protagonist makes me respectful to the anti drug police All drug traffickers deserve to die and those who take the initiative to choose drugs do not deserve the opportunity to reform Behind the so-called psychedelic happiness these people feel is such a cruel truth and how to show the main melody in this way is the most important way for mainland films Direction of effort
1	Support support
1	The play is very brilliant With the limelight of the heavy police in those years the literary play is really bad Its a good commercial film If you pass add 1 star
1	Four stars are for music and clothing
1	The production is excellent and sincere Its not a routine film There are many breakthroughs I cant imagine how to adhere to the ways of dark comedy next second Its too right The fly in the ointment is that there is a lack of Zhous tragic tingling It updates and improves Wu Yifan Lin

1	Because monkey brother so
1	I like movies very much I think they are quite suitable for the Chinese New Year
1	The typical support for this film is not five stars or four stars but there are so many people with psychological imbalance who cant see others It really surprises me that they are eager to jump out of one star to blacken themselves In order to compete with one star they are decisive five stars
1	The last paragraph is too extra I cant help it
1	Stand in line I like watching scuffles Iron man is so pathetic in Captain America Who called Captain America the protagonist? In a trance I thought I was watching the Avengers

1	By chance I saw this film in the National Day file Its a very good theme film Thanks to the special approval of the Ministry of public security he escaped all kinds of sanctions of radio and television In fact its not this film I wouldnt know that this special approval film of the Mekong River incident is still welcome In addition Im very upset about some inflexible feelings in the film
1	The picture is beautiful and the 3D effect is good enough to burst Both of these two points directly catch up with the level of Disney Pixar The action of the martial arts is smooth and coherent Its almost visual Enjoy the whole movie full of tears On the way to the movie I shed tears three times My eyes are wet Thats more Maybe only Qitian Dasheng is our Chinese hero so its particularly emotional to watch him Well Qitian Dasheng wont die About growth freedom Struggle and admit defeat
1	Its funny Its funny enough
0	Id like to eat more crispy sausage tonight
1	Lingpo is a little angel
0	When I watched the movie I always felt that the logic was very confused but I thought it must be the directors careless and gray line I was too careless to see it After turning to Douban film review I knew that your uncle Lu Chuan didnt have logic at all
1	Is it really aesthetic fatigue? Marvel also draws lessons from the stem of corrupt countries for the burden
0	After reading the Dragon searching formula I decided to give a fair score again Its all a mothers family You only have one score
1	Stephen Chow must be a person with a dark mind so everything he shoots has a strong taste but I really love this horror film
1	The most wonderful thing should be the green fat war against the green fat armor Often brain mending the red witch set is drunk without special effects Hahaha • for the subtitles what I want to say is although they are Chinese subtitles you cant find a professional person to turn them if you cant understand what they are saying Its really not OK for me to come
0	After reading it he said he didnt understand the front structure It was OK He didnt know what he was doing at the back He relied on several paragraphs to support it
1	A good commercial film with hot scenes simple plot and clear logic
1	This film is absolutely good Dont listen to those stupid words You think its noble You think youve seen a few foreign films and criticized domestic films The star is poor in skills and has no talent In 2012 and early 2013 I personally think the best movies to see are the sound of the wind and the journey to the West Its best to go to the cinema Theres an atmosphere and the audiences response is very good At least those who have seen it say its good Why are there some brainless sprays on the Internet
1	The IMAX airport battle painted by the group was very enjoyable and dripping Manweilis personal favorite is the concept of iron man technology to change life People yearn for no sense of the US team When Captain pulled the helicopter by hand his muscles were handsome and burst The little Xis saliva next to his forehead was almost dripping on my leg
1	Six to seven points should be given Give a five-star average
1	On the eve of Valentines day I went to the cinema to see in addition to the dreamy dance steps in the background what I saw brought to me was thinking Just like my favorite sentence life is a miss May you not waste your time Life seems to be composed of fragments such as childhood youth and adulthood but you have choices every day That sentence ignores and ignores may make life very different in the future
1	I must see good comedies these years
1	excellent
1	The typical Chinese comedy is in line with the aesthetics of all kinds of people The emergence of Fan Bingbing is really the sublimation of Chinese mentality

1	Xingye is still so imaginative

1	I hope there will be more such films in the future
1	Moved by a boy named Qiu the spare tire in love does not hesitate to break to pieces but moving is not equal to love
1	As a domestic cartoon its good but the plot is not brilliant Where is it worth 5 points
1	Anyway the comments are tearing up the captain Tony is really poor His girlfriend left him and witnessed his parents die His good friend was injured because he helped him However I still stand as the captain and Baji The beauty in the world cant live up to it

1	You might as well be bold
1	If only jazz and movies were enough in life Casablanca
1	Or is the stage play more beautiful
1	This one is not as good as the last one Theres nothing else to say
1	It is clearly a magic reality style but it is wrongly understood as a cartoon In fact it should be animation Stephen Chow is responsible for screenwriting Tsui Hark is responsible for the visual effect Obviously 11 is greater than 2 If the visual effect is too strong people will miss some details However it is absolutely different from the past rough and indiscriminate comedies Not everyone can do this type of film well This film is also excellent in the world

1	No more special effects
0	A perfect marketing film in which the manuscript and the Navy succeeded in driving word-of-mouth is made like a composition of soulless primary school students with fake empty words and stiff patriotism It feels that the manuscript all over the world is using patriotism to kidnap word-of-mouth For the film itself the performance is really ordinary
1	Understand iron man but if I were a superhero I wouldnt sign an agreement Stand in the United States
1	good-looking
1	Give me a smile
0	I really cant get the point of these Oscar films from bird man to youth to love city The score of each film is very high After watching each film I doubt the truth of life In addition to singing singing and dancing the plot is stereotyped In the end the men and women are not together Whats the point that the audience can think of the good episode given by the two stars of their predecessors? They dont give a score to the film
1	Its good that domestic cartoons can be made like this but the martial arts movements still need to be carved Everything else is very good
1	Ive seen it three times and it looks good every time
1	The work of sincerity
0	The director and script of the story of a scum and two bitches are a mess
0	It is suggested that the animal protection organization Dog Love Association boycott this film which not only pollutes our eyes takes away our soft sister coins but also hurts our hearts I said I would be a fool if I saw a domestic romantic film again Ψ ￣ｴ￣ Ψ Yang Mi Moda ￣ ￣ ￣ ￣ ￣ ￣ ￣ ￣ ￣ 9825

1	Once the tap water was released  after watching the recent return of the great sage the online praise was like a tide and today it was decisively watched by the onlookers  it was really well-known Although Hollywood monsters and rubber ducks make people a little jumpy ha ha at least the original intention is a good combination of some current elements The plot originally thought it would be old-fashioned will find another way under the directors intention The whole process is full of laughter and tears It always makes you smile from time to time Or moved to tears
1	Im the kind of person who can seriously separate the picture requirements from the story but its a little disconnected
1	It is still the selling point of the screen action and the plot of justice runs through the whole play However the ideological collision between the US team and iron man can think about the ending There are colored eggs obviously digging holes for the lower part In conclusion if it is not the plot core party film it is still worth watching
1	Funny
1	Its good to have a laugh and a tear
1	This kind of film has to go to the cinema The conflict design is very good The villain also takes the mental route and is farsighted
1	The four little friends of the great sage who went to see it yesterday went together and were over 100 years old Except for the plot the return of the great sage is very good It may be due to the deletion of 30 contents Some of them are too stiff For example the river fell and was not eaten by the heavy rain; The inexplicable white dragon horse; And Wang Fengs sudden howl God Wang Feng almost destroyed it
1	Great Look forward to the future of domestic animation
1	The data analysis proposed by the four-star half vision is not unreasonable This problem was considered at the beginning of the reconnection Whether Bucky should be responsible for Ninis parents death is really a gray area Its hard to tell Nini was too cruel The American team was a little unclear compared with before Finally my widowed sister came out of the sky
0	The two-star picture and dubbing plot annoyed me to death The virgin bitch killed a man and a grandfather and almost killed a race I dont know what these three views are
0	Oh no my eye novel itself is dog blood but at least there are moving local TV dramas that can also be played as the background sound of housework and the men and women play normally What the hell is this film
1	Zhou Dongyu a remake of the novel thought it would be bad but he cried
1	When a person looks at it he thinks his smile is getting higher
1	The realization of a very good movie dream always has some costs The only disadvantage is that it is slightly lengthy and can reduce 20 minutes
1	Smile with tears conscience in domestic films
1	Its funny but some pictures are fake and the whole is good
1	The perfect shape of the US team ah few people understand my winter soldiers position ah the captain is divine
1	Its rare to see a non bad film in the cinema Everyone feels that its more or less July and Anson No one is a single individual The appearance is July The heart may also be the first half of Ansons life the second half of Ansons life or July I think its a lily film After watching the film I feel more like a growth film The preview is misleading face
1	Im dying of laughter
1	Funny but its not as suspense as legend
1	The film has been seen many times in the cinema and the online analysis has also seen a lot of details When watching the film I really didnt find that the special effects of the film are very good the plot is worth remembering and the performance of the actors is also satisfactory Wukong is very handsome and Wu Yifans little monk is also very cute
1	85 points Ive always wanted to go to the cinema since the release I didnt take the time to go to the cinema to support the box office Finally I watched the film on the pad and fell in love with the song brave heart The song selection is great which is in line with the scene of the great saint Its full of childhood memories of the great saint Its cynical and just Ling Ran is full of positive energy Its worth watching in the cinema
0	I was deeply impressed by the three concepts created by the creator What is it? As long as you are kind you dont need to control right and wrong
1	When I came back from business trip I hurried to the cinema for a long time I was moved when I didnt see the film I felt a little abrupt Its really perfect I looked at the comments The comments written by the bad guys are totally unreasonable Are you sure youre watching this film
1	Dont contact relatives in the future Be impressed Cherish the people in front of you and live in the present
0	Your uncle
1	BPs lovelorn heart was completely cured in the award season The song and dance show really has the taste of Hollywood in the last century
0	Even if a gardenia song has been singing for more than ten years its disgusting enough to make a movie
1	The whole process is very high-energy and very cool
1	The rhythm is very tight Director Lin completely depends on this play to wash away the slow and broken wind
0	Im too old to understand
1	Very good 45 points
1	Ive been making up the film of Marvel studios recently Iron man is completely a non cute version of iron wall astro boy
0	The whole play is full of thunder and lightning Do you think the star is at the end of his talent? He cant grind a decent sword after grinding for so long
1	I just want to say that even with a horse face I feel handsome
1	Thats how the main theme movie should be made A good event itself is a good story prototype The rhythm is smooth A lot of camera pictures can be used as computer desktop actors Its good Zhang Xinyu needless to mention that Xiao Peng is one of the few young students who really look good and act well But I want to boast that those foreign actors who play drug dealers especially those boy scouts are paralyzed Sad and scared to pee
1	This film can have such a high box office because the audience looks at the face of the star and wants to say a bad film but they cant bear the two signboards of Stephen Chow and big talk journey to the west are too loud and their feelings come as soon as the familiar music rings out
1	This movie is very suitable for girls They will keep crying for July and Anson and also for themselves
1	I think the dubbing is too bad
1	Return of the king
1	Pig teammates are too stuffed okay
1	good-looking
1	Isnt Youth Friendship
1	I dont have a story Even the song and dance paragraphs are still calm I like the montage at the end of the film Its wonderful and gives a lot of points
1	There are all kinds of dog blood elements in the girlfriends triangle love tearing and pregnancy but they are not made at all The dog blood director and screenwriter have good skills The two female stars also have great performance The original sound and film details are in place It should be the best commercial literary film of the year [the male Lord really likes Ansheng to read the Haibao [[btw plot reminds me of my girlfriend and boyfriend
1	In the first half some plots cant be connected and the transition coherence is a little poor but when the great saint degenerates and is familiar with the music I think theres no reason not to give it five points
1	161004 is good The plot is very compact Wave after wave
1	I feel that everyone in Douban is so high I dont know what movie can make you laugh At least I laugh in the whole audience Several boys around me laugh quickly There is no fresh meat no online jokes and no intention to sell feelings but it makes me laugh all the way Finally it is very warm and moved I will play five stars arbitrarily
1	Very good looking forward to the sequel
1	After reading the 220 Chinese new year I feel more and more that I laugh a little low
1	The biggest highlight of a different youth film is that the laughter points are very vulgar However the film just makes these vulgar laughter points unconventional and poke them in the contradiction
1	At 6 oclock on the Lantern Festival I ran out to see the city of love and music and finally abused me Sister stone is beautiful and commander Gao is so handsome
1	Among the film watching experiences in recent years the film that most wants me to stand up and applaud after the film is over
1	This movie is really too messy and the plot is not coherent
1	Wheres Tonys son
0	I walked out of the cinema half way through it
0	Its not my dish

1	Just once
1	Xu Zheng is good ha ha
1	Every frame is beautiful I cant bear to leave my line of sight and give more stars to the ending
1	Since ancient times red and blue have fallen in love and killed each other
1	In short I will always be the little pink people who shout about the great interests of our country on the side of the US team Have you carefully thought about why to talk about the so-called overall situation when your individuals dont exist
1	Man 2 is the play a little heavier? The first half is beautiful Fortunately dont be too harsh Come on
1	just so so
1	In fact it is not as beautiful as expected
1	Five stars are not perfect I want to see a decompression comedy and its really interesting Thats all
1	Well its weaker than the first one but its still very good-looking Fan Bingbing is really beautiful
1	Its not easy to cherish the fate of someone who loves you
1	This is called a movie
1	The self-identity of a monkey was very moving The feeling of the fire shadow theater version was back There is hope for domestic animation
1	After watching the premiere Meng Da
1	What you see is a feeling
1	In fact its not that bad Illusion is still very handsome
1	Its hard to recommend crying
1	Although Xingye likes to chase women and proud men back and then chase women back In order to hang up proud men proud men admit their love mode in the final analysis he is still a man who feels that only after having been concerned can he get rid of it and the pursuit of his faith is the most important man The film is quite to my appetite
1	Ive seen a lot of film reviews on the return of the great sage before To tell you the truth Im really attracted by the film reviews I also come with a skeptical attitude There are few domestic animation films that make people worry Around me a pair of parents take their children to see the great sage Laughter continued on the way When they saw Jiang liuer die in front of Wukong both parents were wiping their tears with their hands A film that can move peoples hearts is already very good
1	Although the plot is old-fashioned and low self-worth it is also a truth that people understand comedy just doesnt need how high self-worth how novel the plot is and doesnt need any profound meaning Its enough to make people laugh
0	I hate Wang Baoqiangs play
1	Hong Kong Magic 2013 film
1	Unlike the great saint he put the essence in the preface and there are many surprises
1	The demand for going to comedy with a group of people is always low
1	When Charlotte stared at herself in the broken mirror it reminded me whether the butterfly effect would be a better ending if it could be repeated or now we are leading to the best ending
1	This film perfectly interprets the music is the decoration of time After watching the film put on your headphones and listen to the movie original epilogue Its full of picture feeling and emotional expression Its just right Its not intentional or artificial How can you see so many at the beginning of your life? If you think about it its still beautiful
1	The plot is smooth the picture is gorgeous the music is good and the end is filled with joy
0	Too bad to criticize
1	Shocked by the childrens paragraph I dare not think there will be such a scene in reality Its really hard to see the drug dealer being pressed back to China I hope the truth will never be so tragic The largest drug dealer in PS looks a little different from the drug dealer; The second half is a little personal heroism The aura of the protagonist is too obvious If you chase such an important person you two go after exo me literary drama It is still a weakness Even if there are many shortcomings you still have to play four stars
1	Lead singer I love you more Red heart
1	I like domestic movies very much Its great to make a tomb robbing novel into such special effects for more than five yuan Although the rhythm of the plot is too fast those who havent read the novel will be a little confused but its a good film on the whole
1	be in high and vigorous spirits
1	How easy it is for us to miss it
0	The story that has nothing to do with ghost blowing lights is advertising consumer riddles under the name of ghost blowing lights Its really TMD disgusting Lu Chuan is not suitable for commercial films I feel that my IQ has been insulted again
1	Better than one the editing is a little insufficient and the rhythm of Wenwu opera is not well controlled The middle section is a little wordy and boring fighting Its so cool
1	The plot is so thin I blew up my sister and brother They are sweeter than lovers
1	Deduct one point for the plot I feel that the biggest difficulty of Chinese animation has been solved in this film
1	Im really a saint of conscience Ill give you a monkey
1	Its really nice
1	]Return of the great sage A domestic animation can be so vivid vivid humorous free and uninhibited A Wukong character can be so arrogant passionate flesh and blood loving and righteous people will change Even if time and time dont let you change there will eventually be a person to change all of you Im willing to exchange my hundred years of loneliness and difficulties for your peace of mind in your next life
1	First contact with the revision of journey to the West
0	Its terrible The special effects are OK but its really tired If it werent for Stephen Chow how could I go to the cinema and put up with several stars
1	The audience burst into laughter Its interesting to give praise for the happy children nearby
0	Its rotten Who has seen the trailer without a man? Its too rotten Thats all the movie in the trailer
1	not bad
1	Although the laugh point is general it is quite recommended if you dont compare it with the big talk PS pig Huang Bo accounts for one star each
0	The film itself is OK but seriously the score is really high So one star to balance it
1	Benchmarking
1	At first Hayao Miyazakis feeling of Chihiro was a little but with the progress of the story people felt the great Chinese style of love strong domestic dubbing listening to the rain and the gorgeous clothes in the attic were exquisitely carved which was the peak of the new era of domestic animated films
0	Mr He also participated in the rotten film of money encircling especially what starred I really dont have any acting skills I dont understand
1	Never so heartbroken for a domestic animation buy tickets all over the city and objectively evaluate the picture special effects The laughter points are cute and the lighting points are great In the middle we can obviously feel that we are out of money Due to the half-hour plot forcibly cut off by the General Administrations policies the integrity of the story has become a tiger head and snake tail but this does not prevent him from being the leader of domestic animation in recent years We see the sincerity if If the sequel is crowdfunding Ill pay
1	Its different from what I thought Its a relaxed and funny comedy The boys play is very brilliant Everyone is very open-minded The effect is very good The audience often laughs The promise played by Li Yifeng is handsome and gentle It takes seconds to sit on the ground and hum the melody of goodbye The four girlfriends I brought with me
1	Good films have more places to pay tribute to North African espionage such as Bergmans poster the man playing the piano in the bar the reunion in the bar etc North African espionage is more pure as a love film and this film integrates more elements such as song and dance clips adhering to dreams etc However the core is similar that is giving up in order to adhere to good things
1	The flames never cease and the hero never dies
1	Funny? Not much burden but the discussion is good
1	The dark fairy tale style followed by this film is one of my favorite parts of this film because journey to the West may not be what we usually think of as a TV drama version Journey to the west is a difficult story The dark style can better reflect the essence of the film to subdue demons To say that the plot is bad I dont think it is much better than some domestic films
1	Not bad I cried twice
1	Its not a masterpiece but it must be a high-quality work It can find a balance between the original work and re interpretation Moreover NIMA is actually a film about the film Its subtle So far the adventures of the hacker empire Tintin the wizard of Oz the westward journey and the shaping of each characters personality are much better Its really good except for the leather pants Wang its a boiling sheeps feeling A little disgusting other than good and bold and implicit selling corruption
1	Its perfect
0	This is not the demon subduing chapter Its time to take pills
1	It looks better than the first one I dont understand why there are so many stars Is the black star right now
1	Ten thousand years at a glance
1	Absolutely good movie
1	Not to mention the best but the most real and resonant one in the youth film I cried in the middle paragraphs It may be because I was separated from my roommates this year The whole film is actually very flat but our life is not like this It is true that it is flat and light and the second half of the film is still happy The laughter in the cinema also reminds me of the past My first dream work hard for my dream
1	Theres so much that I cant see
1	It can be seen that the director used his heart The return of the great sage must be much better than the haunt of pleasant goat and bear but there is still a certain gap compared with foreign ones At least the return of the great sage has made the attitude of domestic animation to a certain extent
1	Before I saw some film reviews I was very sad After watching the film I was very happy I was very happy I even forgot what kind of protection I wanted without return Big fish Begonia took me to realize the simple love and moving again Although there are still some defects in the narrative technique they may not hide the defects Maybe the story is not a big feeling but who says that the small feeling of tenderness is not as big as big feeling Pregnant
1	not bad
0	Bad movie big bad movie I thought it was a comedy I didnt even see the actors in the preview I dont know who went in and sat down I saw the gun king I was a little cold Then I wanted to go out of the cinema in 20 minutes After watching the movie I felt embarrassed and my cancer turned over Especially what Baubel saw two hours ago I cant remember any plot I danced with Lin Yun and Shu Qi Good dance one star for special effects one star for dance
1	3D printing of New Year film
0	Its not as good as the Han river monster in South Korea more than ten years ago The two brushes of Chinas film industry should stop shooting this theme and make some little comedy music
1	If domestic cartoons are as sincere and willing to pay hard work as this one will they be far from success? No they are not putting something happy to insult their IQ No wonder they are banned abroad
1	Dream of being pulled on the right track by each other - love finally parted ways A city of stars uses memories to make up for the regrets in love; A farewell look has to be gentle and relieved cant help heartache lingers more than a thousand words
1	Seeing your intentions and sincerity my friend who dropped out of Tsinghua University but this work can not reach the milestone of the so-called no good animation in China in 30 years what makes me intoxicated seems not to be the thinking brought to me by the work itself but my own semi illiterate state in front of mythological knowledge Write your feelings of beauty and speculation about the film and speculation about its quality not the film The film itself brings me 5 stars only for feelings
1	1214 신촌 CGV
1	A lot of embarrassing things
1	The story cant pass Fortunately the picture and soundtrack can get extra points There is also one star for brother Qiu Five thousand years is spring and five thousand years is autumn
1	Like it likes movies full of technology although it doesnt understand the main line
1	After watching the special effects for the first time I found that many of the details inside were more and more beautiful Unfortunately it was too obscure and easy to understand I thought it was about four stars but the score was too low so I gave it 5 stars
1	Its very good Ive seen it twice I feel different every time
1	about loveabout dreamabout love we dreamabout dream we love
1	Unexpectedly it was so funny that his face was stiff with laughter
1	70 points cant be higher because I have to be better and work harder to see my intentions in the future so Im very happy I remember when I was at school I was very worried about Guoman and once wanted to join the planning and publicity team to revitalize Guoman
1	In fact you can understand the plot of the whole film as long as you make it clear that [Tang Sengs teachers and disciples are acting] Yes the play in the play is to lead to the big boss step by step in the coordination of acting teachers and disciples from the beginning
1	Cherish the hand you still hold
1	The green widow is really abrupt
1	The movie I saw yesterday was so funny that I dare not say it is good-looking with so and so because everyones aesthetics are different and their feelings are different I like it very much Its rare to see a movie that is not aimed at the stars not at a few D not directed at Mingdao not directed at hype Its so simple and so happy Sometimes its the best blessing to be plain but you dont know how to cherish it and chase it when you lose it Too late to regret
1	The ending is a little light and the actors appearance is not enough Its really a few blocks away from other domestic comedies recently
1	The internal injury left at the end can be relieved for some time After seeing the film for the first time someone applauded commander Gao Finally a film can make me like it Its full of stamina Its changed to five-star 8510 in the morning
1	Laugh a lot
1	The laugh points are all very happy and the twist style is also directed at them In general it meets the expectation After laughing it will make you think and cry
1	There are fewer laughs than I expected but it also happens that BGM and the scenery are very beautiful I like the plot very much I feel very cured After watching it I feel good and make people happy For me the most important thing is to go to the cinema once after watching it online Sure enough I still feel more when there are many people I can laugh together
1	Now I really cant believe Doubans score The film is absolutely worth the ticket price Yacht and Yao Chen are not against each other
1	Why does Douban score lower for a film with a higher level than dragon search formula? Dont say that the 3D effect of dragon search formula is good Is there any advantage besides vision

1	Ive seen it three times once by myself and twice with my friends To tell you the truth I didnt think it was particularly good at the first time The second time I saw it I found a lot of highlights The 3D special effects are very good and the plot is slightly thin In short it can fire for a reason After all there is a great saint in every Chinese heart

1	Almost full of special effects The 3D effect is very good There are a lot of laughter points The whole audience is very happy Several times of collective laughter Although we have seen the MV the rhythm is good and commendable It has a Hollywood style but it is also because the overall westernization of many details is not enough In particular the chaotic real body and mountain demon are very similar to the strange landscape of lostwinds If we can write freehand it will be better The ending is more hasty Look forward to the sequel bar
1	Annual bitterness drama
1	Bursting point Sherlock as most people say a great movie a happy movie doesnt play a regular card This movie should have everything If you want it to have it it will have emotional laughter The plot can not seem to say everything is perfect but its comfortable and no one wants to make complaints about what to do

1	Fan Bingbing appears as a national goddess Recently Ive seen many horror films and profound films to relieve my mood warm and simple
0	Comment on Yixing is really an objective warning to those friends who are attracted by the chapter of subduing demons in the journey to the West Its really two films that are not at the same level The acting skills are shocking The funny stem has also disappeared in front of Wu Yifans acting skills giving people a cold feeling If youre not Wu Yifans diehard fan dont read it Its a special effect The plot is illogical puzzled face
1	The transition is a link between the preceding and the following IMAX is very dazzling
1	Anyway I did cry several times when I saw it Fortunately when I went to see it my eyes were red and I didnt dare to look up As a domestic film such special effects technology is really very very good Later investors can see that the outcome is somewhat hasty but anyway I really think its great to support I hope there will be more such good animated films in the future

0	Looking forward to entering the cinema the result is very dissatisfied Its a film that destroys the three outlooks The good side plagiarizes profligacy and waves and wants to exchange money for other peoples wives The male owner in the film cant bear to look directly at it Even under the guise of nostalgia and funny I cant help laughing Seeing this kind of video can sell well I really worry about the current social mental state of the Chinese public
1	The special effects were good and I really had a good laugh during the movie

0	The cult leaders tears have flowed back into a river and whats the devil willam? Will the director make a sequel about the secrets that he Yichen and willam cant tell
1	I want to say to the people who give one star that the male Lord is very scum Yes he has been thinking about the goddess and has not changed his face However I think the reason why the film does not describe whether the male Lord has a good job in the end is just to let us think that we should not dream like Charlotte Its time to do our work well but lust is allowed Theres no need to over criticize the film Its already great
1	It was pushed by the microblog but it was not so good as the comment but the domestic animation had a good start the stunt effects were good the smile was compact enough and the story stopped abruptly lacking integrity
1	How to say I was very moved at last but I always felt that the feelings of the characters came too suddenly If Chun and Kun were like old friends at first sight and the kindness of sacrificing their lives still makes sense would Qius love be too unprovoked? I dont remember free travel But I still have some impression intermittently The film is still too superficial It just designs some divine animals better Their story origin is not at all

1	Its about several civil wars It can be said that its the best one made by marvel In terms of character depiction its much better than before In particular the process of watching the film for the American team and the iron man is the process of loving the iron man Finally the iron man beat the American team and the winter soldiers Unfortunately they have the aura of the protagonist In addition the little spider and the Panther are also highlights
1	What is more terrible than Conan must be the group injury attribute of multiple connection

1	Its not up to the five-star level but its very good The picture is smooth and the 3D effect is great Although there are loopholes in the plot the relationship between the protagonists is progressing too fast the key to acceptance is Xiong Xiaomeng
0	One star for 3D printing technology and one star for dead trees dragging gold
0	Well if I hadnt read the novel I wouldnt know what the movie is about The rhythm changes too fast and what the ghost is played by why Yichen In contrast I still like to watch the movie version of he Yichen played by Zhong Hanliang It really ruined the whole movie The best acting skill is Zhao Moshengs mother What and what are the others
1	Natural and funny
0	Although I like Mr He this film is really bad In addition the hostess is ugly

1	The painting styles of the protagonists are consistent and have a sense of substitution which is not as bad as what the comments say
1	Its OK It turns out that Huang Bo is still very good at acting The fourth star is to tell him the truth Its fast and slow and it stops abruptly Its a little stiff But I hate the kind of large-scale publicity films on TV and the people around you Have you seen it?

0	Bad films are just worse than the same period films
0	Rotten film
1	The story of the film is not complex and the transition is sometimes stiff but the stories at different stages of the film are quite consistent with their own experience After looking at it I feel a little sad In the second half of the year I will go to Hong Kong to study and settle down After I have a good stay I will go to C University first and have breakfast in New Asia After many years I dont know whether my old friends can meet or even if they meet they are on unrelated professional roads Even if they succeed it will be difficult for each other Find the words of the past
1	I hit Samsung originally Later I was instructed and found that I didnt understand it

He promised that he was a good boyfriend in China My boyfriend began to regret not listening to me and watching the movie I wanted Hee hee but Gardenia bloom was very good Teacher he was great
1	The film has only three points but I want to raise the score for so many unreasonable people In fact it can be seen whether a film is purely for making money I think what the director tries to present is despised by the audience Unfortunately there are few comments on the new year comedy thats all
1	The plot is slightly thin the character setting depiction and dubbing are good and the free heart of the picture is completely incompatible with the overall painting style not to mention the sound quality ￣▽ ￣

1	Is Stephen Chow interested in this kind of shameless and arrogant female male chasing model? See the film review say that this is Stephen Chows confession to Zhu Yins late arrival I think this may not be aimed at Zhu Yin but to the past Moreover if it is true it is not candid enough

1	Why didnt you get 8 points

0	If I havent read and heard the ghost blowing lamp series novels if this film is not called ghost blowing lamp but is called Houyi man vs ghost star man such as bump man beating little monsters it can give three stars with the special effect of 1 yuan inside but if you have to say that this is a ghost blowing lamp adaptation you have to let some bad actors who dont match their image you can only get a bad score
1	The film is not bad The film says protect the safety of every citizens life and property Does this include walking on the road in China
1	Music is life
0	If its not good-looking its beautiful Without the plot its about love triangle
1	Although the plot is a little simple the great saint is so handsome The moment the boy God put on the silver armor again in his childhood is handsome to the sky Although the other special effects are great the action scenes are not explained very clearly There is always a feeling that he cant really see the action scenes In short its still great especially the great saint

0	Although this film is short of laughter for me the special effects of laughter in the cinema are still good in domestic films but if it is taken abroad without comparison it will not hurt In terms of plot this film is very different from the big talk journey to the West in my image Its really disappointing 3-star it

1	Origin is always good-looking Leave one star to support DC
0	A star for Shu Qi
1	I like the opera soundtrack inside I have a feeling that there are heavy traces of imitating the model of Disney animation The story connection and transition processing is a little abrupt and inexplicable However domestic animation has made great efforts to do this and should be encouraged
0	Its as old as ten minutes Its not the same grade as the TV series Theres no logic to let go Why is it such a waste of time to make such a good-looking novel? Its a waste of time to refresh the lower limit of domestic bad films again

0	I dont feel like it
1	In fact its not so bad The plot is hard and the characters dont have a particularly distinctive personality but the animation and music inside are very good If you ignore the plot it can be regarded as a domestic product with relatively high production level The score is so low It is estimated that the main creators play too many emotion cards and what is the best animation in China in the early publicity which gives people too much expectation for this work resulting in greater expectation The greater the disappointment
1	Hes not a comedy Hes just telling jokes in tears
1	Never watch Guoman This is a film that people can watch Although the end is hasty due to financial restrictions Guoman still deserves his conscience
1	ha-ha
1	The conscience of domestic films this year
1	In addition to music and some dubbing its worth liking most The setting of boss is very good before turning into a meat bug  I hope Chinese animation will take off
1	1 From the color matching set to the plot it was full of fantasy until the last imagination was moved The end of the film was like waking up from a dream 2 although it was awkward to dance if you didnt agree with a word the song was really good and worth adding a star
1	There are adaptations but also very novel The plot is good The production is very refined The domestic masterpiece is much better than the foreign Wulitou works In fact wouldnt it be better to follow the original to make an animation masterpiece
1	I love teacher He Li Yifeng Jiang Jinfu Zhang Yunlong Wei daxun Does the play love too much?

It is really a question mark The ending is really cruel I dont know what it is on Valentines day Do you wish to break up
1	After watching it Im optimistic about the director and Zhou Dongyu Im not hypocritical Im going to see it because its directed by Zeng Guoxiang I watched Laoli at station B last time Later I saw Zeng Guoxiang eating noodles alone in the jade steamed bun in Yidi port It was very quiet and polite Later I went to take a group photo with him He saw that my left hand was inconvenient and immediately took it with my right hand to help shoot it At that time he also talked with him about Lao Lis modest image which made me feel that my quality was really high

Did you take your brain down when you went downstairs to throw garbage
1	The unexpected beauty is still because the book is good  drama has a deep moral the song is good and the picture is also beautiful Maybe everyone has a July and Ansheng in his heart and he is more firm and stubborn than women Men are really always counselled and dont know what they want to greet Jiaming
